# TPIP-project

## Structure

The `paper` directory contains the code to replicate the results of the authors.

The `improvement` directory contains the code to create new kinetic mechanisms, 
fit their kinetic constants at fixed T on the experimental data, 
and retreive the best Arrhenius parameters for those kinetic constants.
